= Nyra's Dependencies

There is two sections, one for Nix, and one for General systems. If you are able to use Nix, and dont have grudge about it
I would highly recommend Nix for this project.

== Nix Dev Environment

The Nix way is really helpful, as all you have to do is

[source, shell]
----
nix develop
----

and then you will have everything.

== Other systems

The list of prerequisites is:

. link:https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/[The Rust Toolchain]
. link:https://cmake.org/download/[CMake]
. link:https://releases.llvm.org/download.html[CLang from the LLVM project.]

=== macOS-only dependencies

Since the window framework is the same as Zed-editor (GPUI) you will need Xcode with
MetalPlatform. The Metal platform is **NOT** preinstalled with Xcode 26. Use the app-store to
download Xcode then verify and make sure that the developer target is switched to the Xcode
toolchain by doing:

[source, shell]
----
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
----
